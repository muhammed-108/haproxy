Step 1 Modify the HAProxy configuration file.
In the listen section in the HAProxy configuration file, configure GUI-based HAProxy
monitoring.
listen admin_stat
 bind 0.0.0.0:8443
 mode http
 stats refresh 30s
 stats uri /haproxy_stats
 stats realm Haproxy\ Statistics
 stats auth openEuler:Huawei@123
 stats hide-version
admin_stat indicates the user-defined name, refresh 30s indicates the refresh frequency,
uri /haproxy_stats indicates the URI to the monitoring page, and
openEuler:Huawei@123 indicates the authentication information for logging in to this
page.


Step 2 View the monitoring page.
After the configuration is complete, restart the HAProxy service. Open a browser on the
PC, enter http://EIP:8443/haproxy_stats in the address box, and press Enter. In the
displayed dialog box, enter the user name and password to log in to the monitoring
page.
