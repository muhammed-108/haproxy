Step 1 Install HAProxy.
Run the following command on the HAProxy ECS to install HAProxy:
yum install -y haproxy



Step 2 Modify the HAProxy configuration file.
The HAProxy configuration file is /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. You are advised to back up
the file before modifying it.
This lab implements basic load balancing of HAProxy. You only need to modify the
backend section as follows:

frontend main
 bind *:80
 default_backend http_back
backend http_back
 balance roundrobin
 server node1 10.0.0.2:80 check
 server node2 10.0.0.2:81 check
 server node3 10.0.0.2:82 check
server node4 10.0.0.3:80 check
 server node5 10.0.0.3:81 check
 server node6 10.0.0.3:82 check

After the configuration, run the systemctl restart haproxy command to restart the
HAProxy service. Then access HAProxy from the client. If the configuration is correct, the
result is as follows:
